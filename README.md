Machine Learning Project for Traffic Prediction.

## How to run
- Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (I used homebrew for that).
  ```
  brew tap homebrew/science
  brew install R
  ```
- Install [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Open the R script [traffic-forcast.R](src/traffic-forcast.R) file.
- Run (Select all, press Command + Enter).
- To analyze the data run R script [analysis.R](src/analysis.R).

## Details
This is a linear regression model using sample traffic data as a time series dataset. Seasonality of the data is modeled using the [Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series). And the trending of the data is calculated using a smooth spline. The predicted value is the total traffic expected. The source [data set](src/sample-data.csv) is simulated data for the weekly peak traffic.
- This approach supports multivariate (multiple variables) models compared to FaceBook's [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) which supports univariate (single variable) models.
- We have excluded Covid shutdown period (Mar/Apr/May in 2020).
- We are using 80-20 split for training and testing.
